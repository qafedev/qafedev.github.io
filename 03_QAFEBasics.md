### Starting point: application-config.xml

In the previous chapter the software for QAFE Development was installed. Then a simple project project was created and the QAFE HelloWorld application was shown at runtime.

In this chapter weâ€™ll dive into the anatomy of the QAFE HelloWorld Application.

First of all, all the applications are defined in the

```
/WEB-INF/application-config.xml
```
This the qafe default application-config.xml location, but can be specified to any location from the /WEB-INF/web.xml

The contents on the file can be something like this:

```XML
<applications  xmlns=http://qafe.com/schema
xmlns:xsi=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance xsi:schemaLocation="http://qafe.com/schema
http://www.qafe.com/schema/application-context.xsd">

  <application name="apps" id="system_app" >
    <application-mapping-file location="qafe-default-system-app.qaml"/>
  </application>


  <application name="Hello World" id="myApp" >
    <application-mapping>
       <presentation-tier>
         <view>
          <window id="myWindow" displayname="Hello World">
            <rootpanel>
              <verticallayout>
           	   <button id="myButton" displayname="HellWorld"/>
           	 </verticallayout>
            </rootpanel>
          </window>
        </view>
      </presentation-tier>
    </application-mapping>
  </application>

</applications>
```


The applications that are needed are specified within the application tag in the XML. The application tag has an **id** and **name** attribute. The name attribute is shown in the system application menu shown in the "web" desktop page/qafe landing page which is used to invoke the application. The definition of the application is done within the application-mapping tag.
> The **id** must be unique over all the applications defined in the *application-config.xml*

In the code sample, there are in two applications: *system_app* and *myApp*. The xml file mentioned as attribute value in the *application-mapping-file* tag with the id *system_app* represents the system application menu.

> We call the reference to an *application-mapping-file* a **QAML** file (pronounced as "kamel" file) (therefore also extension .qaml)

In this example the qafe-default-system-app.qaml is in fact an application defined in a QAML file.

```XML
<application name="apps" id="system_app" >
  <application-mapping-file location="qafe-default-system-app.qaml"/>
</application>
```

> NOTE: If you don't want to have the files in your WEB-INF directory, you can modify the application-config.xml to other file locations as long as the file is reachable through a valid URL.

In the second application (id="myApp") the application is defined *inline*. This is useful for demos, but we advise to use external QAML files so that you can use version management on top of it.

### The Anatomy of the application

In the introduction and architecture chapter, this was shown:
![architecte](https://github.com/qafedev/qafedev.github.io/raw/master/assets/images/platformoverview.png)

Every application starts with *application-mapping* tag, since the whole application definition will be mapped in this structure.

See in the image the *Presentation-tier*.This is the layer responsible for the output in the browser.

In the code sample of HelloWorld, this layer is represented as tag (see second tag)

```XML
<application-mapping>
   <presentation-tier>
     <view>
      <window id="myWindow" displayname="Hello World">
        <rootpanel>
          <verticallayout>
            <button id="myButton" displayname="HellWorld"/>
          </verticallayout>
        </rootpanel>
      </window>
    </view>
  </presentation-tier>
</application-mapping>
```

For this sample application we have a view and in there a *window*. This is exactly what it means: It will become a window in the application.
This application show a window with in there a button with the label "Helloworld".

We'll dive into the details of the application itself in the following chapters.

> Important to understand is that each layer of the architecture will be a tag or portion in the QAML file
